# Phase 4 â€“ Visual Comparisons Wireframe (Concise)

Two-column layout with header showing left/right titles and badges, a metrics table in left column and stacked bar chart under it, radar chart in right column, and an evidence accordion below both columns; on mobile, blocks stack vertically with charts following the table and a sticky re-run button at bottom. Header includes confidence + validation badges; metric rows show A/B values and delta with colored indicators. Evidence expands with smooth motion, grouping bullet points. Re-run button triggers the compare call with same inputs. Minimal padding, responsive grid, and keyboard-accessible toggles.
